# Engineering Enablement Coding Challenge

To start the weather API server locally:

  * Ensure you have the correct Elixir, Erlang, NodeJs versions locally (check the .tool-versions)
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `DARK_SKY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here mix phx.server`
  * You can now hit `http://localhost:4000/weather?latitude=1.0&longitude=2.0` and get weather data back!

## Running the spec suite
